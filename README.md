Introduction:

Recipe book is a platform for people to showcase their recipes and to browse recipes shared by others. Registered users can post and share their recipes seamlessly on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. Each user has their profile and tracked/managed in the “My account” page. The simplicity of RecipeBook is powered under the hood by cutting edge technology. RecipeBook completely runs in a self-managing environment with the help of Elastic BeanStalk. 
Once the user registers and logs in using Okta SSO, the user will be redirected to the homepage wherein he/she can post, view add to favourites, or share the recipes on social media platform. The User will be able to browse the recipes and view the popular recipes thus reducing the time to find the favourite recipes.
